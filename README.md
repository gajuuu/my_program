# my_program

This repository contains a collection of programming tasks completed as part of academic work. 
The tasks are categorized into various sub-repositories, covering different programming languages and topics 
such as Python, C++, Java, Haskell, Signal Processing, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Machine Learning.

## Sub-repositories

- [Python](./Python): Basic data structures, algorithms, and simple automation scripts.
- [C++](./C++): Practical examples of memory management and object-oriented programming.
- [Java](./Java): Foundations of large-scale system development and object-oriented design.
- [Haskell](./Haskell): Basics of functional programming.
- [Signal Processing](./Signal_Processing): Fundamental concepts and implementations in audio processing.
- [Data Structures and Algorithms](./DSA): Various data structures and algorithm implementations.
- [Machine Learning](./ML): Implementations of basic machine learning algorithms.

## Purpose
These tasks were designed to solidify understanding of key programming concepts and techniques. 
They serve as practical examples of my ability to solve problems and implement solutions across various domains.

## Usage
