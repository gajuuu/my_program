# Tram vs. Bus Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a model to classify images of Trams and Buses. The work is divided into several key steps:

1. **Data Collection (Weeks 1 and 2)**:
   - Collected approximately 20 samples each of Trams and Buses.

2. **Feature Extraction (Week 3)**:
   - Extracted relevant features from the collected images.

3. **Model Definition and Data Splitting (Week 4)**:
   - Defined the classification model and split the data into Training, Validation, and Test sets.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation (Week 5)**:
   - Trained the model and evaluated its performance using various metrics:
     - **Accuracy**: Ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
     - **Precision**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
     - **Recall**: Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations of that class.

5. **Report Writing (Week 6)**:
   - Compiled a comprehensive report that includes:
     - Details of each step from data collection to model training.
     - Plots showing data statistics and results.
     - Challenges encountered and solutions implemented.

## Files Included
- **report.pdf**: The final report documenting the project's process and results.
- **model_notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the classification model.

## How to Use the Jupyter Notebook

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
   If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the model_notebook.ipynb file**:
    bash
    Copy code
    cd /path/to/project/directory

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook: Run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook**:
    bash
    Copy code
    jupyter notebook
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

4. **Open the Notebook**:  
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate and open model_notebook.ipynb. You can now run the cells to view and execute the model implementation.

## Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Measures the correctness of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the model's ability to identify positive instances.

## Challenges and Solutions
The report includes a section on challenges encountered during the project and the solutions implemented to address them.
