# C++ Implementations

## Overview
This folder contains various C++ implementations demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and techniques. The examples include object-oriented programming principles and basic graphical user interface (GUI) development.

## Contents
- **Basic Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as linked lists, stacks, and queues. These demonstrate essential data handling and manipulation techniques.
- **Projects**: Practical examples and applications, including a simple GUI implementation in the "grading_gui" project.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise examples of fundamental C++ programming concepts. Each implementation is designed to be easily understandable and serves as a foundation for more complex programming tasks.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Application of classes and inheritance.
- **GUI Development**: Basic implementation of graphical user interfaces.

## Installation/Dependencies
No additional dependencies are required beyond a standard C++ compiler.
