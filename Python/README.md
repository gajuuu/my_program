# Python Implementations

## Overview
This folder contains various Python implementations demonstrating fundamental programming concepts and techniques.
The examples include basic data structures and practical applications such as games.

## Contents
- **Basic Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Projects**: Practical examples and applications, including the "tower_of_hanoi" project that uses the Thinker library to implement a game.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to provide practical examples of fundamental Python programming concepts. Each implementation serves as a foundation for understanding core programming techniques and solving real-world problems.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Structures**: Implementation and use of lists, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Practical Applications**: Development of games and other projects using libraries like Thinker.

## Installation/Dependencies
- **Thinker Library**: Install using `pip install thinker` for the "tower_of_hanoi" project.
